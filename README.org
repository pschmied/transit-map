* An attempt to create the interactive transit map of my dreams

The idea here is simple: fit more, and more useful information on an
transit map. Knowing where I am and where I want to go should be
enough info to feed the computer. In return, it should show me nearby
routes and stops, together with real-time arrival info and route
headways. And a pony.

** Usage

LightTable - open ~core.clj~ and press ~Ctrl+Shift+Enter~ to evaluate the file.

Emacs - run cider, open ~core.clj~ and press ~C-c C-k~ to evaluate the file.

REPL - run ~(require 'transit-map.core)~.

** Building
This should work more or less out-of-the-box with Leiningen. There is
one exception: unfolding maps. Tip of the hat to [[https://github.com/jackrusher/citibikes][jackrusher]] for the
hint to install this via a leiningen local repo. Download the
unfolding maps, extract the zip, install the [[https://github.com/kumarshantanu/lein-localrepo][lein-localrepo plugin]] and
then do something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
$ lein localrepo install /path/to/library/Unfolding.jar unfolding 0.9.6
$ lein localrepo install /path/to/library/json4processing.jar json4proc 0.9.6
#+END_SRC

After this, you can add it to the dependencies list in ~project.clj~.
